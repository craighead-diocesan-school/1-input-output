# Māori Mihi

Mihi (greeting) is an extremely important part of Māori culture. Before speaking in a formal setting (such as a marae) it is expected that you announce who you are and where you come from with a mihi. Through a mihi, others can make connections with your pepeha (iwi affiliations to particular natural landmarks) and your whakapapa/genealogy. A mihi has strong spiritual significance as you are speaking on behalf of your tīpuna (ancestors) as well as bringing them along for your kōrero.

## Task

Write a program to help the user create a mihi with the following structure:

> Tēnā koutou katoa,

> Ko [mountain] tōku maunga,

> Ko [river/ocean/lake/bay-harbour] tōku awa/moana/roto/whanga,

> Ko [vessel] tōku waka,

> Ko [people] tōku iwi,

> Nō [home town] au,

> Ko [name] tōku ingoa,



> Tēnā koutou,

> Tēnā koutou,

> Tēnā koutou, katoa.
